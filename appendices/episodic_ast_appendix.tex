\chapter{Alternative FMS Failure Events}\label{cha:fms_events}
This section details alternative failure events investigated and their associated miss distance calculations when stress testing the trajectory predictions in a flight management system (FMS) performed in \cref{cha:episodic_ast}.
Ultimately, analysis of these failure events showed their inadequacy and arc length failures were selected as the primary event.

\section{Tangency Kinks}
Tangency kinks arise when a small angle threshold is exceeded between the inbound straight segment and the tangent of the turn segment at a given waypoint. The failure event occurs when this angle difference $\theta$ is above the threshold $\tau_k = 0.001$ \si{\radian}.

Miss distance for the tangency kinks is calculated by first determining the azimuth angle $z$ between the start point of the arc $s$ and the center point $c$. The azimuth is calculated using a WGS84 Earth flattening leveraging the Geodesic.jl\footnote{\url{https://github.com/anowacki/Geodesics.jl}} package which implements Vincenty's formula  \cite{vincenty}. The tangency angle $\theta$ is then calculated for each $\ell \in L$ where $L$ is the set of lateral packets that each have a straight segment and a turn arc with radius $r$. The sign of the radius $r$ indicates the direction of turn, where left is negative and right is positive. The course-in angle of the straight segment $\ell$ is denoted $\angle \ell$, which we then get a distance metric of:
\begin{equation*}
    d = \tau_k - \max\limits_{(\ell,r) \in L} \abs{z - \angle \ell + \sign(r)\frac{\pi}{2}}
\end{equation*}

\section{Disconnections}
Disconnected lateral packets occur when two sequential lateral packets are not connected end-to-start, thus leaving a distance $\delta$ between them. A failure occured if this geodesic distance $\delta = \lVert e_i - p_{i+1} \rVert$ is above the threshold $\tau_d = 10$ \si{ft}.

\label{fig:disconnection}
\end{figure}

Miss distance is calculated as the threshold $\tau_d$ minus the maximum distance between the end points $e_i$ (or $s_i$ if no arc is provided) and the initial point $p_{i+1}$ of the next lateral packet:
\begin{equation*}
    d = \tau_d \; - \max\limits_{\substack{e_i \in L_i\\p_{i+1} \in L_{i+1}}}\lVert e_i - p_{i+1} \rVert
\end{equation*}

\section{Course Directions}
In-bound and out-bound course directions may deviate from one another and can be classified as a failure event.
Closely related to the \textit{disconnection} failure event, the course direction failures can arise when two sequential lateral packets are disconnected. This failure specifically looks for angle differences between the course-out $\theta_{\text{out}}$ and course-in $\theta_\text{in}$ directions of the sequential lateral packets. If this angle difference $\omega = \abs{\theta_\text{out} - \theta_\text{in}}$ is above the threshold $\tau_c = 1\si{\degree}$ then it is classified as a failure.

\label{fig:course_direction}
\end{figure}

Miss distance is calculated as how close to the threshold $\tau_c$ is the maximum wrapped angle difference between the course-out angle and course-in angle denoted by $\omega$, namely
\begin{equation*}
    d = \tau_c - \max\limits_{\substack{\theta_\text{out} \in L_i\\\theta_\text{in} \in L_{i+1}}}\abs{\theta_\text{out} - \theta_\text{in}}.
\end{equation*}
