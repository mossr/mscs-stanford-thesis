TODO:
[x] combine references.bib
[x] See Dorsa notes
[ ] See Mykel notes
[x] Subsections for tooling: CrossEntropyVariants.jl and FailureRepresentation.jl
[x] Combine Acknowledgments
[x] "dissertation" wording in the signatures page
[x] Remove "graduate studies" committee?


Mykel notes:
[x] Concatenate research papers from MS (if they're related work / extensions)
[x] Add introduction
[ ] Flow together body chapters
[ ] Remove redundancies between them
[x] Change conclusions/future work into discussion
- Two big things:
    [x] 1) intro chapter
        [x] shortest intro chapter possible (concise)
        [x] "freshman undergrad could understand contributions"
    [x] 2) final chapter
        [x] one section "Summary" high level, no jargon, no non-sense
        [x] second section "Contributions", summarize how you've supported your claims (back references, specialized terminology)
        [x] third: future work
[x] https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/Theses/
[x] Fix \texttt to use old monofont
[x] Move JuliaMono font files.
[x] Page header to be small caps
[x] POMDPStressTesting.jl Acknowledgments moved to main Acknowledgments (TRPO/PPO)
[x] Check for duplicate references
[x] Comb through references (you know Mykel will)
[x] Appendix reformatting (figures/fix overflow)
[ ] Clean everything up
[ ] Publically release __after__ approved by Stanford.
[x] Algorithm size \small:
